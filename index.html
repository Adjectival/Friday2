<!-- Don't forget your Git commits or README.

a user can answer questions about themselves and be given a vacation destination based on their answers.

howNatural Kauai, Hawaii
  http://www.gohawaii.com/en/kauai/
howLuxury Monaco, Europe
  http://www.visitmonaco.com/
howRemote Qaqortoq, Greenland
  http://www.greenland.com/

Offer a minimum of 3 vacation destination suggestions. Feel free to use very simple logic, or even ignore the user's responses for some questions.

Site uses branching to return destination.

jQuery is used to show and hide destination after questions are answered and submitted.

Form gathers input from the user.

Variable names are descriptive of what they represent.

Web page is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

Ask for their name and address them directly in all of the responses to them: "Enrique, you ought to set sail for South Africa!".

multiple choice (like a, b, or c); determine which destination is right for a user by identifying the letter that was most frequently selected; for example, "you chose mostly a's, you should book a flight to the Bahamas!".

Use fade in/out or slide in/out jQuery Effects throughout your project. -->
